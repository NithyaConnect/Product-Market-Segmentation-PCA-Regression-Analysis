### Objective

The objective of the project is to perform Factor Analysis to reduce variables in context of market segmentation for hair product service and implement regression model to predict customer satisfaction based on independent variables.

<br>

### Setting Up R Studio and Data Variables

Out of 13 variables, “Satisfaction” is dependent variable and following 11 are independent variables. 

Variable expansion is as follow,

1.	ProdQual =  Product Quality
2.	Ecom = E-Commerce
3.	TechSup = Technical Support
4.	CompRes = Complaint Resolution
5.	Advertising = Advertising
6.	ProdLine = Product Line
7.	SalesFImage = Salseforce Image
8.	ComPricing = Competitive Pricing
9.	WartyClaim = Warranty & Claims 
10.	OrdBilling = Order Billing
11.	DelSpeed = Delivery Speed
12.	Satisfaction = Customer Satisfaction 

In hari.csv file, categorical data represents customers’ votes ranging between 0 and 10. In the date ‘0’ represents least score and ‘10’ represents highest score. In data set, Satisfaction variable is dependent on ProdQual, Ecom, TechSup, CompRes, Advertising, ProdLine, SalesFImage, ComPricing, WartyClaim, OrdBilling and DelSpeed.
